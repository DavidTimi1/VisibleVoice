## **Privacy Policy for Visible Voice**

**Effective Date:** 12-05-2025

Visible Voice ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we collect from users of our browser extension ("Visible Voice Extension") and how we use, store, and protect that information. By using the Extension, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### **1. Information We Collect**

We only collect the following types of information:

* **User Preferences**: We store your accessibility settings such as text simplification preferences, ASL video language choices, and voice control preferences in your local browser storage to ensure your preferences are retained between sessions.

* **Active Tab Content**: When you enable features like text simplification or ASL translation, the extension accesses the content of the active tab in your browser to provide the service.

* **Usage Data**: We may collect non-personally identifiable data related to the Extension's usage, including which features are used most frequently and technical information about the performance of the Extension.

* **External API Calls**: We make calls to external AI services (such as Google's Gemini API) to provide text-to-sign-language translations and simplified text. These external services may process data for the purposes of generating simplified content or translations.

### **2. Permissions**

To function properly, the Extension requires the following permissions:

* **activeTab**: Allows the Extension to interact with the currently active tab to process and simplify visible text, and translate it into ASL or speech.

* **host\_permissions**: Grants access to the content of all web pages you visit in order to apply accessibility features like text simplification and sign language translation.

* **scripting**: Enables the Extension to inject scripts into web pages to modify the content, applying simplified text or translating it into ASL.

* **storage**: Used to securely store user preferences (such as accessibility settings) locally in your browser.

* **tabs**: Provides necessary information about the active tab, ensuring the Extension's features are applied only to the relevant page.

### **3. How We Use Your Information**

* **Simplification & Translation**: The Extension simplifies text on the active webpage and/or translates it into ASL videos based on your settings.

* **Customization**: We use your preferences to ensure the Extension works according to your individual needs for accessibility.

* **Non-Personal Usage Data**: Any usage data collected helps us improve the Extension’s performance, fix bugs, and add new features.

### **4. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not sell or share your data with third parties except as follows:

* **Service Providers**: We may use third-party service providers, such as AI translation services (e.g., Google's Gemini API), to process certain features. These service providers are bound by privacy and confidentiality obligations.

* **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request, such as a subpoena or government investigation.

### **5. Data Storage and Security**

* **Local Storage**: Any user preferences are stored locally in your browser’s storage and are not transmitted to us or any external servers.

* **Security**: We implement reasonable measures to protect your information, including encryption for any external API calls, but we cannot guarantee absolute security, as no data transmission is entirely secure.

### **6. External Links and Third-Party Websites**

The Extension may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites that you visit.

### **7. Children's Privacy**

Our Extension is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.

### **8. Your Rights**

As a user, you have the following rights:

* **Access**: You can access and manage your preferences in the Extension at any time.

* **Deletion**: You can delete your stored preferences by clearing your browser's local storage.

* **Opt-Out**: You can disable the Extension’s features at any time, including text simplification, ASL translation, and voice control.

### **9. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. When we make changes, we will update the **Effective Date** at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
